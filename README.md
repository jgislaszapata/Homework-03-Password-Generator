# Homework-03-Password-Generator

This repository contains a password generator project which allows users to interact with a site that creates randomly generated passwords for them 
depending on a set of criteria specified by the user. 

The site works by prompting the user to specify the length of their password as well as characters it should include once they've pressed the "generate password" button which was provided in the starter code. The series of questions is given to the user through the use of prompts and confirm messages.

This project requires knowledge in JavaScript technologies like data types, functions, iterations, and loops.
